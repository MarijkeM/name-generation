These names are taken as-is when entered. Thus, 1 name entered = 1 Additional Surname for combination with other Names.
It is preferred to use noun + adjectives as an addition to them produces 1*N Additional Surnames for combination.

Where surnames cannot be generated, this is what is used. The main example case would be real-world regional surnames.
