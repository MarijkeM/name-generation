# Name Segments

Here we separate names into their building block components.

Every file should have no empty lines, and comments are allowed (full-line only)

## Contributing

The simplest way to contribute is via *forenames* and *surnames*. However, these are less re-usable than other name elements. 
The best way to contribute is through *nouns* and *adjectives*. These elements will build up to create combinations. If you contribute 2 nouns and 2 adjectives, there's instantly 4 combinations to create a surname



E.G
Adjectives = [Gold, Silver]
Nouns = [Hammer, Arrow]

Results = [Goldhammer, Silverarrow, Goldarrow, Silverhammer]
